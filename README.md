# Restaurant Finder App

---

## Description

This CRUD application is based on Yelp website. You can create restaurant with name, location and price range. Also, you can update or delete each restaurant. Lastly, you can leave a review for each restraurant. I found inspiration for this app at this link [PERN Stack Course - Build a Yelp Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU), but I've made some changes using Redux for all managment states.
